# YOLOv11-Based-Turkish-Plate-and-Character-Detection
This project leverages a dual YOLOv11 architecture to build a complete Automatic License Plate Recognition system. It first detects the Turkish plate using a regionally-tuned model, then uses a separate model to extract and classify individual characters on the plate for high-speed reading.
